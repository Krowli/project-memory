# This file stays because the one-liner that fetches it is published and cannot be
# recalled. Deleting it would pipe GitHub's 404 page into a shell. It installs
# nothing, prints what to run instead, and exits 1 so a pipeline fails loudly
# rather than continuing as if something had been installed.
#
# It still does one thing, because nothing else can: remove what the old installer
# left on this machine. `pipx` and `npm` know nothing about a block that this
# script wrote into an agent's instruction file, so this is the only code that can
# take it back out.

#   sh install.sh --uninstall

# Your pages are not touched, here or by anything else. Scheduled for deletion in

Left alone on purpose:
  .memory/ in your projects     your pages — delete a store yourself if you mean to
  anything you wrote yourself   an agent definition, or a line you added by hand

If you also installed it as a plugin or extension, that install is separate:
  Claude Code   /plugin uninstall project-memory
  Gemini CLI    gemini extensions uninstall project-memory
  Codex, Cursor, Kimi   remove the directory you pointed them at

The program itself, if you have already installed it:
  pipx uninstall pagelore        # or: npm uninstall -g pagelore
  lore uninstall                 # takes out the 0.4.0 block; run it before the above
MSG
  exit 0
fi

cat <<'MSG'
This installer is retired. The program is a package now, and the command is `lore`.

  pipx install pagelore          # Python, no Node needed
  npm install -g pagelore        # Node, no pip needed — it vendors the Python
  lore init                      # writes the instruction block, asks before touching your config

Then, in any project:

  lore search "terminal freeze webgl context lost"
  lore write --slug some-slug --title "One line" --kind decision --source path/to/file --body -

Why: the command an agent had to run used to be an absolute path that differed per
install mode, and it was wrong for two of the three. `lore search` has no path in
it. Updates now arrive with `pipx upgrade pagelore`.

Your pages are safe. `.memory/` did not change and `lore search` finds every page.

Upgrading from 0.3.x? Do this first, in this order:

  sh install.sh --uninstall      # this file, once — takes out the old block
  pipx install pagelore
  lore init

If you skip the first step you get two instruction blocks, and the older one
points at a directory that is gone. Nothing errors: an agent that cannot load an
`@path` simply stops searching, silently.
