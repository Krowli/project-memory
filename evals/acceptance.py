"""Does an agent use the memory when nobody reminds it? Ask the agent.

    python3 evals/acceptance.py --pointer include --agent \'claude
        --setting-sources project --no-session-persistence
        --allowedTools "Bash(lore:*)" "Bash(cat:*)" Read -p {prompt}\'
    python3 evals/acceptance.py --pointer paste --agent \'codex exec -C {project}

        -s workspace-write {prompt}\'

Nothing in this program fires on its own — no hook, and since 0.4.0 no skill
manifest for a harness to index either. The only thing that makes an agent search
before answering is the instruction block, reaching it through whatever import
syntax its harness has. Whether that fires is not something the code can
guarantee, so it is measured here: superpowers\' porting guide reaches the same
conclusion and makes a real-session acceptance run the one proof.

What it does: writes the evaluation corpus out as a real store inside a throwaway
project, connects the memory the way `--pointer` says, runs the agent command once
with a question only the store can answer, and reads the store\'s log. PASS means
at least one search event landed before the agent answered.

`--pointer` chooses how the memory reaches the agent:

  none      nothing at all. Before 0.4.0 this arm still carried the skill
            directory, so it measured whether a harness\'s skill index was enough
            on its own; it measured 0/15. Now it is a true control — the agent is
            told nothing — and it is kept because a control that cannot pass is
            what makes the other arms mean something.
  paste     the block transcribed into the project\'s CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md,
            what a user does on a harness with no import syntax
  include   a one-line `@path` import of the rendered block, what `lore init`
            writes on Claude Code and Gemini
  mcp       no instruction block: the memory reached as MCP tools, whose names
            and descriptions the harness puts in front of the model by itself.
            Pass the agent an `--mcp-config {project}/.mcp.json`, and note that
            Claude Code defers MCP tools behind its tool search unless
            ENABLE_TOOL_SEARCH=false is set — measure the tool list, not the
            assumption.

The agent needs `lore` on PATH; this refuses to run without it, because an agent
that wants to search and cannot is scored the same as one that never tried.
`PAGELORE_BIN` overrides which `lore` runs — an editable install in this tree is
the right target, and a stale `lore` a PATH can already own must not be the one
measured.

`{prompt}`, `{project}` and `{repo}` are substituted into the agent command.
The command is split with shlex, so quote as you would in a shell.
