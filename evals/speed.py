"""What a search costs, end to end, as the command a user types.

    python3 evals/speed.py                    # 90, 1000 and 5000 pages
    python3 evals/speed.py --pages 90 1000    # just those sizes

Two numbers per size, because they answer different questions. The **warm** one
is what a user waits for: the SQLite FTS5 index is built and the query hits it.
The **cold** one is the same search with the index refused, which is what happens
on a read-only checkout, on a Python without `sqlite3`, and while a sibling
process is rebuilding — so it is a real path, not a pessimistic hypothetical, and
it is the number that decides how large a store this design can carry.

Measured as separate processes, not as function calls in this one, because that is
the shape: one process per search, interpreter startup included. Nothing here is
imported from the package for timing; it spawns whatever `lore` the PATH resolves,
and reports which, since a console script and `python -m` are different numbers.

The corpus is the committed 90 pages, grown to a size by suffixing slugs. That
inflates vocabulary overlap, which makes the index look slightly better than a
store of genuinely distinct pages would — the ranking numbers in `run.py` are the
ones to trust about quality. This file is only about time.
