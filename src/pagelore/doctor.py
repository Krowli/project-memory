"""`lore doctor` — the detector for the three states that produce no error.

Every failure this reports is silent by nature, which is the whole reason it
exists:

- **A dangling include.** The agent config points at a block that is not there.
  Claude Code and Gemini resolve a missing `@path` to nothing and say nothing; the
  agent simply stops searching, and nobody connects that to whatever deleted the
  file months earlier.
- **A stale paste.** Codex and Cursor cannot include a file, so they carry a copy
  that no upgrade can reach. It keeps telling the agent to run a command that may
  have moved on.
- **Nothing connected at all.** Measured, an agent with the block searches 15 times
  out of 15 and an agent without it never does. So "installed but not connected" is
  a fault, not a neutral state, and this exits non-zero to say so.
- **An MCP entry the harness cannot start.** The config names a command; if that
  name is not on PATH the server never comes up, and a harness reports that quietly
  or not at all. And a server that starts must answer `tools/list` with the two
  tools — checked by running the very binary the config names, not this install.
- **A shadowing install.** The `lore` a harness starts is the one its PATH names,
  which may not be the one running this doctor; `--version` prints where each
  install lives, so the version probe *is* the comparison, and a binary that will
  not answer it is the old-build case of the same fault.

It also names the leftovers of the pre-0.4.0 layout, which nothing else will.
