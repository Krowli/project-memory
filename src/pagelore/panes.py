"""`lore dev --panes` — the screen that was asked for: an opencode-shaped TUI, opt in.

The console's default is the line editor, and that decision stands: a redrawn
widget holds raw mode for the whole session and needs a pty test that races,
where the line editor is pipe-drivable. The panes are an *extra* screen behind
`--panes` and the internal `panes` command, and they borrow the opencode screen's
shape one to one — because that is the shape that was asked for, twice:

- fresh: a logo, a big "Ask anything…" box, a hint bar with the path, the
  shortcuts and the "model" tag;
- once commands have run: a transcript — every command echoed like the prompt
  with its output underneath — and the field shrunk to the bottom line. `/` (or
  ctrl+p) *always* opens a centred command picker with one hint per command;
  `o` opens the top hit of the last search; `↑` walks history.

Commands run in-process through the same `cli.main` the CLI runs, so the output
and the `exit N` codes are bit-for-bit what an agent would see from the same
position — and then the transcript renders the well-known outputs readably:
a `search` turn shows one card per hit (slug, title, the matched window dim
underneath, score and date on the right) instead of the CLI's wrapped prose,
with the raw bytes still stored on the turn. `curses` is POSIX and the screen
needs a real terminal; where either is missing, `--panes` says so and falls
back to the line editor, so a pipe driving `lore dev --panes` still reads lines.

What a key decides is a pure function on `State`, so the bulk of the screen is
tested the way the line editor is: called directly, no terminal — including the
session model, which turns a command into a transcript turn. Only the draw loop
touches curses, and one pty test proves the raw screen draws, runs commands from
the box, opens the picker from a non-empty field, and answers keys. Commands
that must own the terminal (`mcp`, the init wizard, `edit`) are refused from the
field, not half-run.
