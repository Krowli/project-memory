"""Search project memory. Prints ranked `slug — title — snippet`.

Usage:  lore search "query words" [-k N] [--store DIR] [--json]
                          [--touching PATH ...]

Ranking is BM25F over two fields — title (+ slug) and body. See
references/retrieval.md for how it was chosen, what it was measured against, and
what of that measurement is reproducible from this repository.

`--touching PATH` puts the pages whose `sources` name that file (or anything
under that directory) ahead of every lexical hit, marked in the result line. It
may stand alone or accompany query words. Sources are not in the index, so this
reads every page — measured, that is the scan path's cost, and it is paid only
when the flag is given.

The write gate runs here too. A page under MIN_BODY that matched the query is
not ranked; it is named on stderr and in `--json` so it can be rewritten through
`lore write`. A page with no sources is shown, marked. Search runs on every
harness the skill is installed in, which is what makes this the place for it:
a hook that denies a hand-written page exists on one harness only.

Two retrieval paths, one ordering. A persistent SQLite FTS5 index (index.py)
answers when it can; when it cannot — no FTS5 in this interpreter, a read-only
store, a sibling process rebuilding, a corrupt file — the pages are read and
ranked in process instead. Slower, never stale, never a traceback.

Stdlib only.
