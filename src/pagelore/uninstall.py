"""`lore uninstall` — take the connection back out.

`pipx uninstall` removes the program and cannot run it, so it knows nothing about
the file this program edited in the user's agent configuration. Without this
command the fenced block survives as an `@include` pointing at a file nothing will
recreate — a dangling include, which produces no error and silently stops the
agent searching. That is the same failure the whole instruction-block design was
chosen to avoid, so leaving it to `pipx` is not an option.

It removes exactly what `lore init` wrote, and says what it deliberately did not:
the pages are the user's, and a program that can delete them by accident is worse
than no uninstaller.

The MCP route is taken out the way it went in: our entry is dropped from the JSON
files this program merged it into — and a `.mcp.json` that is empty afterwards is
deleted, because this program created it, while Gemini's settings.json and
Cursor's mcp.json are never deleted, because Gemini and Cursor write them too — and where the entry went through the harness's own
`mcp add`, its `mcp remove` is run when the harness is here and printed when not.
