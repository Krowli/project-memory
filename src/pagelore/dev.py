"""`lore dev` — the same commands, in a console.

A bare `lore` opens this on a real terminal; `lore dev` opens it on demand, and
`--sandbox` runs it against a throwaway store so that `write`, `init`, `uninstall`
and the rest can be rehearsed against nothing that matters. Every line is one lore
command, run in its own child process from the current directory (or the sandbox),
so the exit codes, the output and the `FIX:` lines are exactly what an agent would
see in the same position. That is the whole point: the slow part of trying a new
build used to be installing it; the console makes the thing under test the one in
this tree, and a pipe is enough to drive it.

This is a line editor, not a menu: built on `input()` and the `readline` module
where Python ships it, with the chrome between commands printed rather than
redrawn on keypresses. So there is no raw mode and no cursor handling for a pty
test to race; what the pty test proves is the one thing a pipe cannot — that a
real terminal gets the prompt and that typed commands actually run.

The split is the same one `menu.py` draws for the wizard: a terminal gets the
interactive surface, and anything else — an agent, a script, a CI job — keeps the
plain behaviour, which is how a bare `lore` still answers a probe with usage and
exit 0.
