"""`lore mcp` — the same memory, reached over MCP instead of by running a command.

    lore mcp            # speak MCP on stdin/stdout until stdin closes

Not a second implementation. Every call lands in the functions the CLI already
calls, so retrieval quality, the index and the write gate cannot differ between the
two routes — a page refused here is refused with the same reason and the same
`FIX:` line the command prints.

This was a probe in `evals/` for a month and measured before it shipped: on Claude
Code's default settings an agent with only these tools searched 0 times in 15,
because the harness defers MCP tools behind its tool search; with the deferral off,
or with the instruction file as well, 15 in 15 — equal to the instruction file
alone, never better. So the file stays the default `lore init` recommends, and this
is the choice a person makes with the numbers in front of them. The probe stays as a
wrapper so the measurement can be re-run.

Two rules the transport imposes, both easy to break silently:

- stdout carries JSON-RPC messages, one per line, and nothing else. Every
  diagnostic goes to stderr. Messages are written as bytes so that a Windows text
  stream cannot turn the line ending into `\\r\\n`, and so that the router's
  `errors="replace"` never touches a payload.
- The store is not where the process happens to be standing. Claude Code makes no
  promise about a stdio server's working directory and puts the project root in
  `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` instead; `resolve_store` reads that, after the explicit
  `PROJECT_MEMORY_DIR`, before falling back to the cwd walk every command uses.
