"""`lore init` asks four questions, and the questions have to be tested.

The shell installer this replaces shipped a dead prompt: a question placed after
the value it was supposed to decide, so both answers led to the same place. It
passed review because the only test that could reach the prompts drove a pty, and
nobody wrote one for that branch.

So interactivity here is a parameter with `isatty()` as its default, and these
drive the interactive path directly. A test that merely pipes stdin would take the
non-interactive branch and prove exactly as little as piping into the old script
did. One pty test at the end proves the default wiring itself.
