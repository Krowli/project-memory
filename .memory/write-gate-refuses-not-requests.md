## Context

The corpus this skill was designed against had 104 of 495 pages that were
auto-generated stubs, bodies around 139 characters, and they took the top two
result slots for real queries. The rules file asking the agent to keep the store
tidy was present the whole time. Asking did not work.

## Decision

The quality check lives in the write path, not in prose. A page with no source, a
source path that does not resolve, a body that leaves the page under 200
characters, an unknown kind or a non-kebab slug is refused: exit non-zero, plus a
`FIX:` line naming the exact next command. The correction then lands inside the
agent's own tool loop, where it acts on it, rather than in a document it may
never read.

## Consequences

Refusal codes are short stable tokens rather than prose so they can be counted: a
gate firing constantly on one code is either a real corpus problem or a rule that
needs loosening, and there is no way to tell which from memory.

The gate had an unguarded side door until a `PreToolUse` hook closed it: the
ordinary Write tool could create a page directly, so "writes are refused, not
requested" was itself a request. This project's own CLAUDE.md states the rule that
was being broken — prefer a hook over prose for anything that must hold.
`PROJECT_MEMORY_ALLOW_HAND_EDIT=1` is the deliberate escape hatch, checkable in a
way a promise in prose is not.
