## Cause

The request behind `--panes` came back twice, and both times it was not browse:
"a TUI like the opencode one" — a screen you look at the memory through and type
into, one to one with opencode's own screen. The first pass answered with a
two-pane browser plus a command field, and it still read as a file editor: the
field was invisible until you started typing, the list and preview dominated.
So the layout was reversed into opencode's actual shape, captured from a real
pty of opencode 2.x: first an empty state — a logo, a big "Ask anything…" box,
a hint bar — then, once a command has run, a transcript of turns with the field
shrunk to the bottom line. `/` or ctrl+p opens a command picker that fills the
command word into the field, `o` opens the top hit of the last search (the slug
is never retyped), `↑` walks history, PgUp/PgDn scroll the transcript, `q` is
back to the line editor.

## Measured

The keystroke number moved with the layout and was recomputed by the same
deterministic script rather than re-argued: the picker flow `/ se ↵ <query> ↵ o`
still never retypes the slug, and find + read now saves `len(slug) + 7`
keystrokes instead of `len(slug) + 10` — opening the hit costs one `o` instead
of one Enter, an honest, smaller number. Every command still spawns 0 processes
where the line editor spawns one child per line.

## What did not change

Commands run in-process through the same `cli.main`, and byte-for-byte fidelity
against a real child is still a test. Terminal-owning commands (`mcp`, `dev`,
`edit`, `panes`, the init wizard without --yes) are still refused from the
field. The line editor stays the default, the bare-`lore` probe contract is
untouched, and a pipe driving `--panes` still falls back to the editor.

## Readable rendering

The second round of feedback was about the raw transcript, not the layout: a
`search` painted as wrapped prose and "you cannot tell what is where". The
screen now renders a plain `search` turn (query, no flags) as cards — a
numbered line with the slug and title, the score and `updated` date
right-aligned, and the matched window dim underneath — built from the same
ranked rows the CLI printed (`search(..., k=10)` mirrors the CLI default, so
the card count always equals the count the raw header line promises). The raw
bytes stay bit-for-bit on the turn: flagged searches keep their byte-for-byte
text, the first line (the count, so the pty tokens survive) and the trailing
`skipped` warnings are kept, and the fidelity test against a real child never
changed.

## The picker always opens, centred, with hints

`/` once inserted a literal slash when the field held text — which read as "no
hints at all". `/` and ctrl+p now *always* open the picker. It is a bordered,
centred panel with one hint per command, a filter that narrows as you type
(the other keys still edit the field), a window that slides so the cursor
stays visible, and a footer that says when more commands exist above or below.
The panel's rectangle is blanked before drawing, so a modal menu hides the
logo, ask box or transcript behind it instead of leaking around its borders;
the next full redraw (every frame is erased and rebuilt) restores what it
covered. Esc closes the picker and clears the field; `curses.set_escdelay(50)`
makes Esc land fast instead of letting curses wait out its ~1 s escape-sequence
timeout and swallow the next key.

## The bare search asks for the query

As the user reports keep showing, an intermediate "query step" (a `search:
<query>` placeholder) read as an instruction to retype `search <word>`, so it
is gone. Today a bare `search` (no query, no flags) runs nothing and leaves
the field as `lore > search ` — cursor after the space: the user's own text
never leaves the main screen, only the query is missing, Enter again is a
no-op, and no argparse usage ever dumps. `submit` rewrites the field instead
of toggling a mode, so there is no second screen to be asked to repeat.
With a query already appended (`search <word>` + Enter) it runs straight
through, as always.

## A bare search waits for the query, on the same line

Enter on a bare `search` (no query, no flags) used to paint argparse's usage
line — the "type `search "text"` again" screen. An intermediate version then
opened a "query step" (`search: <query>` placeholder); the placeholder started
with the word `search`, read as an instruction to type `search <word>` again,
and was dropped for this one: a bare `search` leaves the field as `lore >
search ` (cursor after the space) and runs nothing. The user's own text never
leaves the main screen, only the query is missing, Enter again is a no-op, and
there is no second screen to be asked to repeat. `submit` does this by
rewriting the field, not by toggling a mode.
