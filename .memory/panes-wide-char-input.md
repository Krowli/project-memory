## Cause

The panes field gated input on `32 <= key <= 126`, the ASCII band. Cyrillic
(and any multibyte UTF-8) reaches curses as one `getch` int per byte, all
≥ 128, so every Cyrillic keystroke was silently discarded — a real search
over a bilingual store could never be typed. A second latent bug rode along:
`field_insert` advanced the cursor by 1 no matter how many characters it
inserted.

## Fix

`_wide_char` assembles one character: read the lead byte (128–255), drain the
UTF-8 continuation bytes (0x80–0xBF) with a 30 ms window timeout — so the last
character of a burst decodes when the burst ends, not one keystroke later —
then restore blocking; a non-continuation byte is pushed back with
`ungetch`. The decoded letter is inserted through the same `field_insert` in
both the field and the picker (its filter reads the field). `field_insert`
now advances the cursor by `len(ch)`.

## Tests

`test_the_screen_draws_like_opencode_and_runs_commands` types a Cyrillic
query into the query step and asserts it echoes and runs; `wait_for` strips
CSI sequences first, because ncurses can emit erase-to-EOL between the bytes
of one printed word. Unit coverage: a Cyrillic query composes and runs.
