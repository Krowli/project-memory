# CI's install-smoke job proves a freshly built distribution works as a user
# would use it. This script is that same job run from the repo: it builds the
# wheel, installs it into an isolated environment (pipx when present, else a
# throwaway venv), and runs the same steps — write, search, --touching, stats,
# doctor, the refused-write FIX: line, and the whole MCP route. Everything lives
# under one temp dir and the run gets a throwaway HOME, so nothing on this
# machine is touched: not the real `lore`, not a store, not a config file.

# The one thing this cannot rehearse is the act of publishing itself; that has
# its own rehearsal, TestPyPI, wired into the release workflow's dry-run.

Enough body to clear the floor the write gate applies, so the page is
actually written and the command after this one has something to find.
A shorter body is refused, which is the behaviour being relied on here.
