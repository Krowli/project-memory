"""Create or update a memory page.

Usage:
  python3 memory_write.py --slug SLUG --title TITLE --kind KIND

Re-running with the same slug replaces same-header sections and appends new
ones, so repeated calls are safe. What was replaced is printed, because a
replacement is destructive and the default store has no VCS behind it.

**A page that is not worth keeping is refused, not written.** The refusal exits
non-zero and names the next command, so the correction lands in the agent's own
loop instead of in a rules file it may not read. This is the whole design: in
the corpus this was built against, 104 of 495 pages were auto-generated stubs
whose bodies ran to about 139 characters, and they took the top two result slots
for real queries.
