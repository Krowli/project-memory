"""A persistent SQLite FTS5 index over the store — a cache the search may ignore.

The pages are the memory; this is only a way to find them faster. Every function
here returns `None` rather than raising, and `memory_search` falls back to reading
the markdown directly. That rule is not defensive style, it is the design: a
store on a read-only checkout, on a network home, owned by another user, or being
rebuilt by a sibling process must still answer, slower.

Why the shape is what it is — each of these was measured before it was written:

- **No WAL.** WAL cannot be read from a read-only database and does not work on a
  network filesystem, which is exactly what `install.sh --store home` invites
  (an NFS or iCloud home directory). The default rollback journal reads fine in a
  0555 directory. WAL would also buy nothing: every process here is a writer.
- **The index lives outside the store.** In `tracked` mode anything inside gets
  committed, and a store created before this feature existed would never receive
  a new `.gitignore` line. It is keyed by a hash of the store's *resolved* path,
  so the `home` symlink and its target share one index.
- **Freshness is `(mtime_ns, size, ino, ctime_ns)` compared for equality.** Not an
  ordering: a clock that steps backwards makes a page look older, and "newer than
  the index" then reads stale content as fresh. Not `(mtime, size)` alone: `tar
  -xp`, `rsync -a` and `cp -p` restore mtimes, and only `ino`/`ctime` catch an
  equal-sized rewrite underneath them.
- **Rebuild whole, never repair in place.** A repair perpetuates any change it
  missed; a rebuild self-heals on the next mismatch. It is written to a temporary
  file and moved into place, so a reader never sees a half-built index.
- **One builder, elected without waiting.** With subagent fan-out, twenty searches
  hitting a cold index gave eleven `database is locked` failures. The winner of a
  non-blocking lock rebuilds; everyone else queries what is already there, and
  falls back to reading the markdown when the index does not yet cover the store.
