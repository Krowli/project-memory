# Retrieval

`memory_search.py` has two paths and one ordering. A persistent SQLite FTS5 index
(`memory_index.py`) answers when it can; otherwise every page is read and scored
in process with the BM25F below. Both drop zero scores and return the top `k`. Ordering is score, then the
more recently `updated` page, then slug — alphabetical order used to decide which
of two equally scored pages the agent read first, which is how a reversed decision
could come out on top of the decision that reversed it. A page carrying
`superseded_by` is scored at `SUPERSEDED_WEIGHT` (0.5) of its BM25F score, so it
stays findable without outranking its replacement. Only top-level `*.md` files are
indexed. There is no server.

## Why BM25F — measured, reproducibly

```bash
python3 evals/run.py --by-type
```

90 pages, 270 known-item queries, 12 ambiguous, 20 unanswerable. Corpus, queries,
methods and scorer are all committed under `evals/`. Confidence intervals are a
bootstrap over queries; the comparisons are **paired**, because every method sees
the same queries.

| method | nDCG@10 | vs shipped, paired |
|---|---|---|
| **shipped, FTS5 index** | **0.649** | — |
| shipped fallback, in-process BM25F | 0.644 | +0.004 [−0.009, +0.018] — **not a difference** |
| scan with the title weight at 0 | 0.595 | +0.054 [+0.027, +0.081] |
| term-count scoring | 0.432 | +0.216 [+0.164, +0.267] |
| `grep -rilE` (unranked) | 0.113 | +0.535 [+0.480, +0.586] |

Three things follow.

**Ranking earns its place against what it replaced.** Term counting is 0.216
nDCG@10 worse, far outside the interval. Unranked grep is not in the same
discipline at all — it is 0.535 behind, because it returns every page sharing any
word, in filename order.

**The title weight is real but modest**: +0.054 [+0.027, +0.081]. An earlier,
unreproducible measurement recorded +0.069; direction and rough size hold up.
`tests/test_retrieval_quality.py` fails if it goes back to zero.

**The two shipped paths are indistinguishable in quality**, which is what makes
the index safe to prefer: it is chosen for speed, and it costs nothing in what the
agent actually gets back. Choosing between the formulas on quality grounds would
be reading noise.

### The historical figures

An earlier version of this document argued the design from a private measurement:
110 real agent queries from a production store's call log, 3 984 hand-graded
pairs, three judges, kappa 0.69–0.73. **Those artifacts are in no repository**, so
no reader could check them. They are kept here only as the record of why the
choice was made, and everything load-bearing has since been re-measured above.

| method | nDCG@10 | 95% CI |
|---|---|---|
| hybrid BM25 + bge-m3 via RRF | 0.788 | [0.759, 0.817] |
| **BM25F (this)** | **0.757** | [0.726, 0.787] |
| dense, chunk-level | 0.696 | [0.659, 0.732] |
| dense, whole-page | 0.683 | [0.644, 0.720] |
| term-count scoring | 0.660 | [0.612, 0.705] |

Two deltas decided it. Term-count → BM25F is **+0.097 [+0.053, +0.144], p=0.0001**
and costs nothing. BM25F → hybrid is **+0.032 [+0.002, +0.061], p=0.041** — an
interval whose lower bound sits two thousandths from zero — and costs a resident
1.2 GB embedding model, ~95 ms added to every query (1.27 s if the model has been
evicted), and 286 s to build the index for 491 pages. The first delta is free and
large; the second is paid and inside the noise.

Dense retrieval is not uniformly better even where it is supposed to win. On the
plural query type — bag-of-keywords, 55% of the real log — it is **−0.113
[−0.163, −0.064], p=0.0001** against BM25F. It gains on conceptual prose
(+0.056, p=0.085, interval crosses zero). Failure mode observed by the judges:
`bge-m3` answers the query `sidecar` with `sidebar-*` pages.

## The index, and why it is only a cache

The pages are the memory. The index says which file to open, nothing more, and any
doubt at all falls back to reading the markdown — slower, never stale, never a
traceback. Measured end to end, as a shell invocation, on this machine:

| pages | reading every page | warm index | |
|---|---|---|---|
| 90 | 235 ms | 99 ms | 2.4x |
| 1000 | 1887 ms | 174 ms | 10.9x |
| 5000 | 4637 ms | 196 ms | 23.6x |

A warm search is nearly flat in corpus size; what is left is interpreter startup
and one `stat()` pass over the store. The ~5000-page ceiling this document used to
name is gone.

Six decisions, each bought by a probe rather than a preference:

- **No WAL.** A WAL database cannot be read from a read-only store at all, and WAL
  does not work over a network filesystem — which is exactly what
  `install.sh --store home` invites on a corporate or cloud-synced home directory.
  The default rollback journal reads fine in a `0555` directory.
- **The index lives outside the store**, in `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/project-memory/`,
  keyed by a hash of the store's resolved path. Inside the store it would be
  committed in `tracked` mode, and a store created before this feature existed
  would never receive a new `.gitignore` line. Resolving the path first means the
  `home` symlink and its target share one index instead of building two.
- **Freshness is `(mtime_ns, size, ino, ctime_ns)` per page, hashed, compared for
  equality.** Not an ordering — a clock that steps backwards makes a page look
  older, and "newer than the index" then serves stale content as fresh. Not
  `(mtime, size)` — `tar -xp`, `rsync -a` and `cp -p` restore mtimes, and only the
  inode and ctime catch an equal-sized rewrite underneath them. Hashed rather than
  stored, because parsing a per-page structure on every search cost a second at
  5000 pages for an equality test.
- **Rebuild whole, into a temporary file, moved into place.** A repair perpetuates
  whatever change it missed; a rebuild self-heals at the next mismatch, and a
  reader never sees a half-written index.
- **One builder, elected without waiting.** Twenty searches onto a cold index gave
  eleven `database is locked` failures; the winner of a non-blocking lock rebuilds
  and everyone else queries what already exists. A naive version of that had
  nineteen of twenty silently answer from an index still being written, so a
  coverage floor sends a caller to the markdown when the index does not yet hold
  most of the store.
- **The tokenizer is ours, and the index records its version.** FTS5's own
  tokenizers lose three behaviours with regression tests behind them: NFC
  normalisation (macOS NFD `ёлка` becomes unfindable), `casefold` (`STRASSE` /
  `straße`), and compound-identifier splitting. So `tokenize()` output is stored
  space-joined and FTS5 only splits on whitespace — which makes tokenisation part
  of the on-disk format, and a change to it without a rebuild would be zero recall
  with no error anywhere. The stamp forces the rebuild.

The two paths are different formulas, so the order of the low-scoring tail can
differ; measured, that is not a quality difference (+0.004 nDCG@10,
[-0.009, +0.018]). `--json` reports `served_by`, so a disagreement between two
agents in one fan-out is explainable rather than spooky.

## A result list always looks confident

The most useful thing the harness measured is a negative result. On 20 realistic
questions about the same project that **no page answers**, every method — this one,
FTS5, term counting, grep — returned hits for all 20. And the obvious fix does not
work: the top hit's score for a question the store cannot answer is
indistinguishable from one it can.

| median of the top hit | answerable | unanswerable |
|---|---|---|
| BM25F score | 5.32 | 5.29 |
| share of query words present | 0.60 | 0.56 |

A cutoff at any score that removes a meaningful share of the unanswerable set
removes more of the answerable one. Requiring 60% of the query's words to appear
kills 60% of the unanswerable queries and 36% of the correct answers with them.

The reason is structural, not a tuning failure: a question about a project you do
not have a page for still uses that project's vocabulary. Lexical scores measure
overlap, and the overlap is there either way.

So this is not fixed in the ranker, and the instruction to the agent carries it
instead: the list is not evidence that an answer exists, and each hit has to be
judged on what it says. Any system that returns a ranked list has this problem;
what is unusual here is only that it is measured.

## Parameters

`k1=1.2`, `b=0.75` — textbook. A cross-validated sweep found a different optimum
worth 0.017 nDCG@10, which does not justify carrying tuned constants that were
probably fitted to one corpus's quirks.

`W_TITLE=5.0` is the parameter that matters: raising the title weight from 0 to 5
is worth **+0.049 nDCG@10 [+0.025, +0.077]** on the corpus in `evals/`, an order of
magnitude more than k1 and b combined.

IDF is the Lucene form, `log(1 + (N − df + 0.5) / (df + 0.5))`. The classic
Robertson form goes negative once a term appears in more than half the corpus,
which actively penalises a page for containing the word "the".

Both fields are combined into one pseudo-frequency and saturated **once**
(that is what makes it BM25F rather than two BM25 scores added together —
the additive variant measured 0.024 nDCG@10 worse).

## Tokenization

`\w+` with the Unicode flag, over text normalised to **NFC** and folded with
`casefold()`. Both of those are load-bearing rather than cosmetic:

- `\w+` does not match combining marks, so without normalisation macOS's NFD
  `ёлка` tokenised as `['е', 'лка']` and matched nothing an editor writing NFC had
  produced. Recall across that boundary was zero, on the two most common
  diacritic letters in Russian — the language this store's bilingual claim is
  about.
- `casefold()` rather than `lower()` also folds `STRASSE` / `straße`.

The store is Cyrillic/Latin bilingual and tested that way. It is **not**
segmented: CJK returns one token per unbroken ideograph run, so retrieval for
Chinese, Japanese and Korean collapses to whole-phrase equality, and Thai
fragments meaninglessly. A tokenizer that fixes that needs a real segmenter,
which is not in the standard library; until then this is a known limitation
rather than a degraded mode.

Compound identifiers are indexed both whole and in pieces: `useAgentStream`
becomes `useagentstream`, `use`, `agent`, `stream`. Splitting happens before
folding, on `_` and at lower→upper boundaries only, so an all-caps `PTY`
survives intact. This inflates the index ~40% and measured **+0.0997** nDCG on
prose queries against **−0.0101** on identifier lookups — a good trade only
because identifier lookups were rare in the query log this was measured on (one
in every 154 queries recorded, across a longer window than the 110 graded for
ranking). On a corpus queried mostly by symbol name, re-measure before keeping it.

No stopword list (−0.0026 quality for −7% index size) and no minimum token length
(monotonically harmful: `pty`, `ws`, `id`, `v2`, `ru` all carry signal).

## Cost, and when to stop using this

Measured on one machine, on synthetic corpora built by replicating a real
491-page store, at roughly 5 KB per page. Both numbers matter: at the ~1.5 KB
pages a real store tends to produce these times are around 3x lower, and absolute
wall clock on another machine measures that machine. Treat the shape as the
result, not the constants.

| pages | build (whole index) | query |
|---|---|---|
| 491 | 0.29 s | 0.10 ms |
| 5 401 | 2.76 s | 0.19 ms |
| 50 082 | 25.4 s | 0.93 ms |
| 200 328 | 100.8 s | 3.37 ms |

Query time is never the problem; rebuilding is. **Around 5 000 pages** the
rebuild-everything-per-write model stops being free, and the right move is SQLite
FTS5, where an incremental edit is 0.21 ms flat regardless of corpus size and cold
open is 7 ms. If you do that, note that FTS5 joins bare query terms with implicit
AND — a two-word query then returns nothing. Terms must be joined with explicit
`OR`. This is a real bug that shipped in a production system and went unnoticed
for months.

A plain `grep -r` is faster in wall clock — it is not an *alternative*. Asked the
OR-of-terms question a real query needs, it returns an unranked list: on a
5 000-page store `grep -rilE` over three ordinary terms matched 98.7% of the
corpus. Ranking is what is being bought here, not speed. Where grep is genuinely
the better tool is a known literal — a slug, a file path, an error string — and
for that it should be used directly.
