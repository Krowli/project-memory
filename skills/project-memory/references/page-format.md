# Page format

One file per topic at `.memory/<slug>.md`, written by `memory_write.py`. Do not
write these files by hand: the script validates them, and hand-edited
frontmatter is the one input the parser cannot round-trip. A `PreToolUse` hook
denies a direct Write or Edit to a page and names the command instead.

Frontmatter is YAML-ish and parsed leniently. This is the contract:

| Field | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `slug` | yes | lowercase, digits, single hyphens; matches the filename |
| `title` | yes | one line, quoted |
| `kind` | yes | exactly one of `decision`, `bug`, `concept`, `howto` |
| `created` / `updated` | auto | ISO dates, managed by `memory_write.py` |
| `sources` | yes | file paths this page explains; each must exist at write time |
| `supersedes` | no | slugs this page replaces (`--supersedes`) |
| `status` / `superseded_by` | auto | stamped on the page that was replaced |

`kind` is a hint rather than a taxonomy, but it is a closed set: the corpus this
was designed against grew a machine-generated fifth kind to 23% of all pages and
none of it was worth reading.

`sources` is accepted both inline (`sources: [a.ts, b.ts]`, written by older
pages) and as a block list. The parser handles both; the writer always emits the
block form. A single unquoted value is read as a one-item list.

Any field the tooling does not own is **preserved verbatim** across writes, so
the format can be extended without a migration.

```markdown
---
slug: webgl-context-loss
title: "xterm WebGL context loss on display sleep"
kind: bug
created: 2026-08-08
updated: 2026-08-17
sources:
  - src/terminal/renderer.ts
---

## Cause

The WebGL renderer loses its context when the display sleeps; xterm never
repaints because the addon does not observe `webglcontextlost`.

## Fix

Listen for the event and re-attach the addon. See [[terminal-renderer-choice]].
```

## Conventions

Write the body for someone who has forgotten the incident: what was observed,
why it happened, what was decided, and what would make you revisit it. One topic
per page — if a page needs "and also", split it. Cross-reference with
`[[slug]]`, which is the page's filename without the extension, so following one
is a single read.

Re-running the same slug replaces same-header sections in place and appends new
ones; the command prints what it replaced. Sections are matched on `## ` lines
outside code fences, so a page may quote markdown safely.

When a decision reverses an earlier one, record the new page with
`--supersedes <old-slug>`. That stamps the old page as superseded, demotes it in
ranking, and marks it in every result line — the alternative is two pages that
both read as current.
