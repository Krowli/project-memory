# Installation

pagelore is one program with two names: `lore`, the documented one, and
`pagelore`, for a machine where something else already owns `lore`. Every message
names whichever one you ran, and `lore init` writes that name into the block your
agent reads.

Requires **Python 3.9 or newer** — what a stock macOS ships. The runtime has no
dependencies outside the standard library.

## From PyPI

```bash
pipx install pagelore              # recommended: an isolated environment, `lore` on PATH
pip install --user pagelore        # also works
uv tool install pagelore           # with uv
uvx --from pagelore lore search …  # run once without installing
```

## From npm

```bash
npm install -g pagelore
```

The npm package is a shim, not a port: it finds a Python interpreter and hands it
the Python source vendored into the tarball at pack time. It runs no `pip` and no
`postinstall` script, so `--ignore-scripts` and a corporate registry mirror both
work. It tries `python3` then `python` (on Windows `py -3`, `python`, `python3`);
to pin one, set `PROJECT_MEMORY_PYTHON` — see [configuration](configuration.md).
If you already have `pipx`, `pipx install pagelore` is the same program and needs
no Node.

## From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Krowli/project-memory && cd project-memory
make dev                  # .venv with an editable install, pytest and ruff
.venv/bin/lore --version
```

In a clone with nothing installed, `python3 -m pagelore …` works from the
repository root with `src/` on `sys.path`. See [CONTRIBUTING](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Connect an agent, then check

```bash
lore init
lore doctor
```

`lore init` writes the instruction block to `~/.project-memory/AGENT.md` and then
asks four questions — where it applies, which agents, how they reach it (file or
MCP), and where this project's pages live. The details, and the flags that answer
them in a script, are in [connecting agents](agents.md). `lore doctor` checks the
result; its messages are explained in [troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md).

Installing without connecting anything installs nothing useful: measured, an agent
with no instruction line and no MCP server never searched. A bare `lore` says so
in one line, and `lore doctor` calls it a failure.

## Which install is running

```bash
lore --version        # or: lore version
```

prints the version, the name it was run as, the Python, and the directory the
package runs from. If you installed through both pipx and npm you have two `lore`
on PATH; `lore doctor` fails when the one on PATH is not the one running it.

## Upgrading

```bash
pipx upgrade pagelore          # or: npm update -g pagelore, uv tool upgrade pagelore
```

The instruction block is refreshed by the next `lore` command you or your agent
runs, so there is nothing to re-copy. A **pasted** copy — Codex's `AGENTS.md`, a
project `AGENTS.md`, Cursor's User Rules — is the exception: run `lore init`
again, and `lore doctor` reports a stale one.

## Uninstalling

In this order:

```bash
lore uninstall                 # take the block and the MCP entries back out
pipx uninstall pagelore        # or: npm uninstall -g pagelore, uv tool uninstall pagelore
```

`pipx uninstall` cannot run pagelore's code, so it would leave the fenced block
behind as an `@include` pointing at a file nothing will recreate — and an agent
that cannot load an `@path` does not error, it just stops searching.

`lore uninstall` removes only what `lore init` wrote:

- the fenced block in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md` and
  `$CODEX_HOME/AGENTS.md` (default `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`), and — inside a git
  repository — in that project's `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md` and `AGENTS.md`;
  everything you wrote around the fence stays;
- the `project-memory` MCP entry in the project's `.mcp.json` (deleted if it is
  then empty), `.gemini/settings.json` and `.cursor/mcp.json`, and in
  `~/.gemini/settings.json` and `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (those files are never
  deleted);
- for `~/.claude.json` and Codex's `config.toml` it runs `claude mcp remove
  --scope user project-memory` / `codex mcp remove project-memory` when that
  program is on PATH, and prints the command when it is not.

`lore uninstall --yes` also removes `~/.project-memory/` (the block, not your
pages). **Your pages are never touched**; delete a `.memory/` directory yourself if
you mean to.

## Upgrading from 0.3.x

0.3.x installed a skill directory and wrote a line pointing into it. That
directory is gone, so do this once, in this order:

```bash
sh install.sh --uninstall      # or re-run the curl one-liner; it now only uninstalls
pipx install pagelore
lore init
```

`lore init` also recognises and replaces the old marker, so if you forget the
first step you get one block rather than two. A plugin or extension install is
separate:

```
Claude Code   /plugin uninstall project-memory
Gemini CLI    gemini extensions uninstall project-memory
Codex, Cursor, Kimi   remove the directory you pointed them at
```

`lore doctor` names a leftover `~/.agents/skills/project-memory` directory.

## Platforms

Tested in CI on Ubuntu, macOS and Windows against Python 3.11 and 3.13, and on 3.9
on Linux and Intel macOS, on both retrieval paths (FTS5 index and the in-process
ranker). The 3.9 floor is declared once and enforced everywhere it matters:
`requires-python` stops pip, and the npm shim treats exit 69 from an older
interpreter as "try the next one".
