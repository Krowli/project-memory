/*
 * `lore`, for people who have npm and would rather not think about Python.
 *
 * This is a shim, not a port. It finds an interpreter and hands it the vendored
 * package; every decision about ranking, the write gate and the store lives in
 * that Python and nowhere here, so the two install routes cannot drift.
 *
 * Three things here are deliberate and were each paid for:
 *
 * 1. No `pip`, and no `postinstall`. A postinstall script that installs packages
 *    is the thing corporate npm mirrors and `--ignore-scripts` both break, and it
 *    fails at install time in a way the user cannot act on. The Python is copied
 *    into the tarball at pack time and imported from there.
 * 2. The first candidate is spawned with the real arguments rather than probed
 *    first with a throwaway `--version`. A cold search is around 86 ms, and a
 *    probe process would roughly double the figure the README publishes.
 * 3. Exit 69 (EX_UNAVAILABLE) from `python -m pagelore` means "this interpreter
 *    is older than the floor". The package prints nothing in that case, because a
 *    message there would print once per candidate; the message below prints once,
 *    after every candidate has been tried.
