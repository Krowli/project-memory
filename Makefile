# The local dev loop for this repository. Everything a change needs before it
# earns a tag: the editable environment, both retrieval paths, lint, and the
# install-smoke rehearsal that CI runs against the built wheel.

#   make dev     one command into the editable environment
#   make test    pytest on both retrieval paths, then ruff
#   make smoke   build the wheel, install it in isolation, run it end to end

# PYTHON picks the interpreter for `dev`; override with e.g. `make dev PYTHON=/opt/homebrew/bin/python3`.
